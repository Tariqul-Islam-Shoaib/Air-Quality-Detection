Project: Dhaka Air Quality Detection

This project is based on Machine Learning. Air quality monitoring is a critical concern in densely populated urban areas like Dhaka, Bangladesh, where air pollution poses significant health and environmental challenges.
This study examines an air quality dataset through data preparation and a variety of machine learning models for prediction. Preprocessing operations are carried out on the dataset, including
managing missing values, encoding category characteristics, and standardizing numerical features. We train and test three distinct regression models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
and Linear Regression. Performance of the models is contrasted between before and after hyperparameter adjustment. Insights regarding feature scaling, model training, testing, comparison, 
and selection are provided in the study.
